Before you begin, it would be beneficial for you to understand the entire process of joining IDOs (Initial Dex
Offerings) at Elysium Launchpad.

For this reason, we have provided an updated comprehensive guide covering all the necessary details.

## The Know Your Client (KYC) process

First, we want to share that each Elysium Launchpad IDO participant needs to complete the KYC process with a third-party
app called Block-pass to ensure compliance with all regulations.

Please remember that certain countries have particular cryptocurrency regulations that we must follow. Regrettably,
citizens of countries that prohibit their participation in initial token offerings will also be unable to participate in
Elysium Launchpad IDOs. We do this to ensure our service adheres to all applicable laws and regulations.

Initial offerings are legal in most parts of the world, so after you complete the identity verification, you are ready
to participate in future IDOs according to your tier and PYR holdings!

## Buying PYR

If you don’t have any PYR, you can buy it from exchanges
like [Swap](https://swap.elysiumchain.tech) ,[Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/trade/PYR-USDT)
or [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/vulcan-forged-pyr). However, to
participate in IDOs,
the wallet you provide in the KYC process must be the same wallet you interact with our Launchpad smart contract.
Therefore, if you buy tokens from a centralized exchange
like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/vulcan-forged-pyr), you first need to transfer your tokens to a
wallet like Metamask.

For best practices and security, a cold wallet (Ledger, Trezor, Safepal) connected to your Metamask is recommended to
store your tokens and interact with the blockchain.

Elysium Launchpad has a tier system in which the more PYR you have, the larger the tokens you get from the Initial Dex
Offerings.
