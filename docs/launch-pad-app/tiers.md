# Tier System

There are 9 tiers in current tier system consists of a system where it is based on guaranteed allocations for almost all tiers.
For the lowest tiers, most launchpads use a lottery-based system, and even though we want to go with guaranteed allocation for all tiers, with a big base of users, guaranteed allocations for the lowest tier result in a problem that the allocations become too small.

| Tiers  | Allocation    | Staking Amount |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| Tier 1 | Lottery Based | 300 PYR        |
| Tier 2 | Guaranteed    | 1100 PYR       |
| Tier 3 | Guaranteed    | 2250 PYR       |
| Tier 4 | Guaranteed    | 6500 PYR       |
| Tier 5 | Guaranteed    | 8250 PYR       |
| Tier 6 | Guaranteed    | 110000 PYR     |
| Tier 7 | Guaranteed    | 22250 PYR      |
| Tier 8 | Guaranteed    | 55000 PYR      |
